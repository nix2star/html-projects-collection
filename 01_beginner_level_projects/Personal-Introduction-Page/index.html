    <h1>👋 Hello, I&#39;m Nicole!</h1>
    <p>I am an enthusiastic self-taught aspiring full stack developer who desires to make an impact in the tech industry. My goal is to work in London for a Big Tech or Fintech company so that I create and maintain systems that inspire, change and transform the world. Coming from a non-tech background, having obtained a BCom in Economics with the University of South Africa, I believed that transiting to tech would be a daunting experience. But as soon as I began, I have never turned back. After 7 months of coding, I can safely say that I am beginning to enjoy the experience. </p>
